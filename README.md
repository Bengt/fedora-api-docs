# Fedora (unofficial) API Documents

The Fedora project runs a lot of really neat projects, and most of them offer
API access for developers to create tools and libraries around them.

For example, you can access everything you might want to know about a Fedora
package by using the **Packages** API, see what groups you are in by using the
**Accounts System** API, vote on packages using the **Tagger** API, and see how
well you rank on the leaderboard through the **Badges** API. Then, when you're
all done with that, you can go create a new project using the **Copr** API, and
submit builds to it.

As someone who experiments with a lot of programming languages and
environments, I enjoy making libraries in languages that I use to ease the
programatic use of these services. However, I've found that most of these APIs
lack any form of extensive documentation. A lot of times, I'm forced to look at
the source code of one particular implementation of an API and hope that it
does things the optimal way.

I'd rather have a document for each API that describes how it works, the best
way to use it, the available endpoints, examples of use, and any caveats I
might run into as I make use of the API.
